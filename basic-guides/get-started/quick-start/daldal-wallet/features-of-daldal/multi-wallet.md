# Multi-Wallet

## Import

You can use Multi-Wallet with DALDAL.

That means if you have made multiple wallets of FINL, you can use those together with DALDAL WALLET.

If you import another wallet, you can use that one too. You can change the wallet by choosing the one of the wallets.

## Disconnect

If you decide to do not use the wallet anymore, you can easily disconnect the wallet with the button.

Don't be afraid to make a decision. You can import it again if you still have the KeyStore File and remember the password of disconnected wallet.
