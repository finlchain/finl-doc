# What is FINL?

## The Solution for Blockchain Trilemma

There is a trilemma in blockchain. The three problems of scalability, decentralization, and security cannot be solved at once. FINL focused on scalability and security among these three issues. Based on high availability nodes and a fast network, even if the number of users increases, the transmission processing capacity can be increased. In addition, security is increased by adding a security element to the block chain. This does not mean, however, that decentralization has been abandoned. A decentralized consensus organization called DGOS has been established and efforts are being made to protect users' rights through voting.
