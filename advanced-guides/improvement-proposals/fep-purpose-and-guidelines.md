# FEP Purpose and Guidelines

## What is an FEP

FEP stands for FINL Enhancement Proposal. An FEP is a design document providing information to the FINL Chain community, or describing a new feature for FINL Chain or its processes or environment. The FEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The FEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## FEP Rationale

We intend FEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into FINL Chain. Because the FEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For FINL Chain implementers, FEPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the FEPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.

## FEP Types

There are three types of FEP:

* A Standard Track FEP
* An Informational FEP
* A Meta FEP

### A Standard Track FEP

A Standard Track FEP describes any change that affects most or all FINL Chain implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using FINL Chain. Furthermore, Standard FEPs can be broken down into the following categories. Standards Track FEPs consist of three parts, a design document, implementation, and finally if warranted an update to the formal specification.

#### Core

Core - improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to Block Producer and Block.

#### Networking

Networking - improvements around p2p protocol.

#### Interface

Interface - includes improvements around client API specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like contract formats. For contract formats, it aligns with the FINL Chain contracts repo and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before an FEP is submitted to the FEPs repository.

### An Informational FEP

An Informational FEP describes an FINL Chain design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the FINL Chain community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational FEPs do not necessarily represent FINL Chain community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational FEPs or follow their advice.

### A Meta FEP

A Meta FEP describes a process surrounding FINL Chain or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process FEPs are like Standard Track FEPs but apply to areas other than the FINL Chain protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to FINL Chain’s codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational FEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in FINL Chain development. Any meta-FEP is also considered a Process FEP.

It is highly recommended that a single FEP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the FEP, the more successful it tends to be. A change to one client doesn’t require an FEP; a change that affects multiple clients, or defines a standard for multiple apps to use, does.

An FEP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

## FEP Work Flow

Your role as the champion is to write the FEP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea. Following is the process that a successful FEP will move along:
