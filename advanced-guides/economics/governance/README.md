The basic supply for each year is 60 million, and based on the inflation standard supply of 600 million for each group by year.

Inflation is generated by applying an inflation weight to the authority for issuance by year and group is It is at the DGOS foundation.

#### Weighted filter formula

$$
Z_k = A * exp(-B *i) + C
$$

The basic inflation rate (IR) for each number of nodes is 8%, and the inflation weight ($$Z_k$$ ) for each node is applied to A 86.43% to 167.19% inflation weight ($$N_k$$ ) is given. Accordingly, from node 1 to node 70, It has an initial inflation rate of 6.91% (8% \* 86.43%) and 13.38% from the 911 node to the 980 node. It has an initial inflation rate of (8% \* 167.19%).
