## Currency and Issuance

### Unit of Currency

The platform coin, FIN, consists of 9 decimal places. For each three decimal places, the name of each unit is zoned, redo.

|    Unit |             FIN |
| ------: | --------------: |
| 1 kitty |       0.001 FIN |
| 1 goofy |    0.000001 FIN |
| 1 micky | 0.000000001 FIN |

### Currency Issuance

The basic supply for each year is 60 million, and based on the inflation standard supply of 600 million for each group by year.

Inflation is generated by applying an inflation weight to the authority for issuance by year and group is It is at the DGOS foundation.

#### Weighted filter formula

$$
Z_k = A * exp(-B *i) + C
$$

The basic inflation rate (IR) for each number of nodes is 8%, and the inflation weight for each node ($$Z_k$$ ) is applied to A 86.43% to 167.19% inflation weight ($$N_k$$ ) is given. Accordingly, from node 1 to node 70, It has an initial inflation rate of 6.91% (8% \* 86.43%) and 13.38% from the 911 node to the 980 node. It has an initial inflation rate of (8% \* 167.19%).

#### Inflation rate by number of nodes ($$N_k$$)

$$IR=8%$$

$$Z_k = A * exp (-B * i ) + C;$$$$where A = 138.06306475, B = 0.06764022, C = 29.12741104, 1 \leqq k \leqq 14, and 13 \geqq i \geqq  0$$

| ---------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | ---------------------: |
