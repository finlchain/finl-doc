## Replication

Replication takes place between cluster NNs in the data path, between NNs and ISAGs within a cluster, between NNs and FBNs within a cluster, and between FBNs and external FBNs. In addition, replication is performed between IS and ISAG of each cluster in the control path.

Synchronization is made with each other through replication between major nodes that make up the m ainnet ecosystem, and As the number of FBNs increases, the ecosystem expands and becomes richer.

## Shard

ISAG can shard is as an option.

## Query

You can request information from FBN to check the data of the mainnet's Data Path. Control Path infor mation is requested from ISAG.
